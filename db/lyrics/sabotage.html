I can't stand it, I know you planned it<br />
I'm gonna set it straight, this Watergate<br />
I can't stand rocking when I'm in here<br />
'Cause your crystal ball ain't so crystal clear<br />
</p><p>
So while you sit back and wonder why<br />
I got this f**kin thorn in my side<br />
Oh my God, it's a mirage<br />
I'm tellin' y'all, it's a sabotage<br />
</p><p>
So, so, so, so listen up 'cause you can't say nothin'<br />
You'll shut me down with a push of your button?<br />
But you, I'm out and I'm gone<br />
I'll tell you now, I keep it on and on<br />
</p><p>
'Cause what you see you might not get<br />
And we can bet, so don't you get souped yet<br />
You're scheming on a thing that's a mirage<br />
I'm trying to tell you now, it's sabotage<br />
</p><p>
Why
Our backs are now against the wall?<br />
Listen all y'all, it's a sabotage<br />
Listen all y'all, it's a sabotage<br />
Listen all y'all, it's a sabotage<br />
Listen all y'all, it's a sabotage<br />
</p><p>
I can't stand it, I know you planned it<br />
I'm gonna set it straight, this Watergate<br />
Lord, I can't stand rockin' when I'm in this place<br />
Because I feel disgrace because you're all in my face<br />
</p><p>
But make no mistakes and switch up my channel<br />
I'm Buddy Rich when I fly off the handle<br />
What could it be, it's a mirage<br />
You're scheming on a thing, that's sabotage<br />
