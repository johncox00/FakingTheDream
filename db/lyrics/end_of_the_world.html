That's great, it starts with an earthquake, birds and snakes, an aeroplane -<br />
Lenny Bruce is not afraid. Eye of a hurricane, listen to yourself churn -<br />
world serves its own needs, regardless of your own needs. Feed it up a knock,<br />
speed, grunt no, strength no. Ladder structure clatter with fear of height,<br />
down height. Wire in a fire, represent the seven games in a government for<br />
hire and a combat site. Left her, wasn't coming in a hurry with the furies<br />
breathing down your neck. Team by team reporters baffled, trump, tethered<br />
crop. Look at that low plane! Fine then. Uh oh, overflow, population,<br />
common group, but it'll do. Save yourself, serve yourself. World serves its<br />
own needs, listen to your heart bleed. Tell me with the rapture and the<br />
reverent in the right - right. You vitriolic, patriotic, slam, fight, bright<br />
light, feeling pretty psyched.<br />

It's the end of the world as we know it.<br />
It's the end of the world as we know it.<br />
It's the end of the world as we know it and I feel fine.<br />

Six o'clock - TV hour. Don't get caught in foreign tower. Slash and burn,<br />
return, listen to yourself churn. Lock him in uniform and book burning,<br />
blood letting. Every motive escalate. Automotive incinerate. Light a candle,<br />
light a motive. Step down, step down. Watch a heel crush, crush. Uh oh,<br />
this means no fear - cavalier. Renegade and steer clear! A tournament,<br />
a tournament, a tournament of lies. Offer me solutions, offer me alternatives<br />
and I decline.<br />
</p><p>
It's the end of the world as we know it.<br />
It's the end of the world as we know it.<br />
It's the end of the world as we know it and I feel fine.<br />

The other night I tripped a nice continental drift divide. Mount St. Edelite.<br />
Leonard Bernstein. Leonid Breshnev, Lenny Bruce and Lester Bangs.<br />
Birthday party, cheesecake, jelly bean, boom! You symbiotic, patriotic,<br />
slam book neck, right? Right.<br />
</p><p>
It's the end of the world as we know it.<br />
It's the end of the world as we know it.<br />
It's the end of the world as we know it and I feel fine...fine...<br />
