Tommy used to work on the docks <br />
Unions been on strike <br />
He's down on his luck... it's tough, so tough <br />
Gina works the diner all day <br />
Working for her man, she brings home her pay <br />
For love - for love <br />
<p></p>
She says we've got to hold on to what we've got <br />
Cause it doesn't make a difference <br />
If we make it or not <br />
We've got each other and that's a lot <br />
For love - well give it a shot <br />
<p></p>
Whooah, we're half way there <br />
Livin on a prayer <br />
Take my hand and we'll make it - I swear <br />
Livin on a prayer <br />
<p></p>
Tommy's got his six string in hock <br />
Now he's holding in what he used <br />
To make it talk - so tough, it's tough <br />
Gina dreams of running away <br />
When she cries in the night <br />
Tommy whispers baby it's okay, someday <br />
<p></p>
We've got to hold on to what we've got <br />
Cause it doesn't make a difference <br />
If we make it or not <br />
We've got each other and that's a lot <br />
For love - well give it a shot <br />
<p></p>
Whooah, we're half way there <br />
Livin on a prayer <br />
Take my hand and we'll make it - I swear <br />
Livin on a prayer <br />
<p></p>
We've got to hold on ready or not <br />
You live for the fight when it's all that you've got <br />
<p></p>
Whooah, we're half way there <br />
Livin on a prayer <br />
Take my hand and we'll make it - I swear <br />
Livin on a prayer <br />
