You don't have to put on the red light<br />
Those days are over<br />
You don't have to sell your body to the night<br />
Roxanne<br />
You don't have to wear that dress tonight<br />
Walk the streets for money<br />
You don't care if it's wrong or if it's right<br />
</p><p>
Roxanne<br />
You don't have to put on the red light<br />
Roxanne<br />
You don't have to put on the red light<br />
</p><p>
Roxanne put on the red light<br />
Roxanne put on the red light<br />
Roxanne put on the red light<br />
Roxanne put on the red light<br />
Roxanne put on the red light<br />
</p><p>
I loved you since I knew you<br />
I wouldn't talk down to you<br />
I have to tell you just how I feel<br />
I won't share you with another boy<br />
I know my mind is made up<br />
So put away your makeup<br />
Told you once I won't tell you again<br />
It's a bad way<br />
</p><p>
Roxanne<br />
You don't have to put on the red light<br />
Roxanne<br />
You don't have to put on the red light<br />
