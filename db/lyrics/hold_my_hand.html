<p>
With a little love, and some tenderness<br />
Well walk upon the water<br />
Well rise above this mess<br />
With a little peace, and some harmony<br />
Well take the world together<br />
Well take em by the hand<br />
</p><p>
Cause Ive got a hand for you<br />
Cause I wanna run with you<br />
</p><p>
Yesterday, I saw you standing there<br />
Your head was down, your eyes were red<br />
No comb had touched your hair<br />
I said get up, and let me see you smile<br />
Well take a walk together<br />
Walk the road awhile, cause<br />
</p><p>
Cause Ive got a hand for you<br />
Ive got a hand for you<br />
Cause I wanna run with you<br />
Wont you let me run with you? yeah<br />
</p><p>
Hold my hand<br />
Want you to hold my hand<br />
Hold my hand<br />
Ill take you to a place where you can be<br />
Hold my hand<br />
Anything you wanna be because<br />
I wanna love you the best that, the best that I can<br />
</p><p>
See I was wasted, and I was wasting time<br />
Till I thought about your problems, I thought about your crimes<br />
Then I stood up, and then I screamed aloud<br />
I don't wanna be part of your problems<br />
Don't wanna be part of your crowd, no<br />
</p><p>
Cause Ive got a hand for you<br />
Ive got a hand for you<br />
Cause I wanna run with you<br />
Ah, wont you let me run with you?<br /> 
</p><p>
Hold my hand<br />
Want you to hold my hand<br />
Hold my hand<br />
Ill take you to the promised land<br />
Hold my hand<br />
Maybe we can't change the world but<br />
I wanna love you the best that, the best that I can, yeah<br />
</p><p>
Hold my hand<br />
Want you to hold my hand<br />
Hold my hand<br />
Ill take you to a place where you can be<br />
Hold my hand<br />
Anything you wanna be because<br />
I...oh...no, no, no, no, no<br />
</p><p>
Hold my hand<br />

Hold my hand<br />
Ill take you to the promised land<br />
Hold my hand<br />
Maybe we can't change the world but<br />
I wanna love you the best that, best that I can<br />
Oh, the best that I can<br />
