<p>
Blame it all on my roots <br />
I showed up in boots <br />
And ruined your black tie affair <br />
The last one to know <br />
The last one to show <br />
I was the last one <br />
You thought you'd see there <br />
And I saw the surprise <br />
And the fear in his eyes <br />
When I took his glass of champagne <br />
And I toasted you <br />
Said, honey, we may be through <br />
But you'll never hear me complain <br />
</p><p>
'Cause I've got friends in low places <br />
Where the whiskey drowns <br />
And the beer chases my blues away<br /> 
And I'll be okay <br />
I'm not big on social graces <br />
Think I'll slip on down to the oasis<br /> 
Oh, I've got friends in low places <br />
</p><p>
Well, I guess I was wrong <br />
I just don't belong <br />
But then, I've been there before <br />
Everything's all right <br />
I'll just say goodnight <br />
And I'll show myself to the door<br /> 
Hey, I didn't mean <br />
To cause a big scene <br />
Just give me an hour and then<br /> 
Well, I'll be as high <br />
As that ivory tower <br />
That you're livin' in <br />
</p><p>
'Cause I've got friends in low places <br />
Where the whiskey drowns <br />
And the beer chases my blues away <br />
And I'll be okay <br />
I'm not big on social graces <br />
Think I'll slip on down to the oasis <br />
Oh, I've got friends in low places <br />
