<p>
Just a small town girl, livin' in a lonely world <br />
She took the midnight train goin' anywhere <br />
Just a city boy, born and raised in south Detroit<br /> 
He took the midnight train goin' anywhere <br />
<p></p>
A singer in a smokey room <br />
A smell of wine and cheap perfume<br /> 
For a smile they can share the night <br />
It goes on and on and on and on <br />
<p></p> 
Strangers waiting, up and down the boulevard <br />
Their shadows searching in the night <br />
Streetlights people, living just to find emotion <br />
Hiding, somewhere in the night. <br />
<p></p>
Working hard to get my fill, <br />
Everybody wants a thrill <br />
Payin' anything to roll the dice,<br /> 
Just one more time <br />
Some will win, some will lose <br />
Some were born to sing the blues <br />
Oh, the movie never ends <br />
It goes on and on and on and on<br /> 
<p></p>
Strangers waiting, up and down the boulevard <br />
Their shadows searching in the night <br />
Streetlights people, living just to find emotion <br />
Hiding, somewhere in the night. <br />
<p></p>
Don't stop believin' <br />
Hold on to the feelin' <br />
Streetlights people <br />
<p></p>
Don't stop believin' <br />
Hold on <br />
Streetlight people <br />
<p></p>
Don't stop believin' <br />
Hold on to the feelin' <br />
Streetlights people<br />
