When I'm out walkin', I strut my stuff -- yeah, I'm so strung out<br />
I'm high as a kite; I just might stop to check you out<br />
Let me go on... like I blister in the sun<br />
Let me go on... big hands, I know you're the one<br />

Body and beats, I stain my sheets -- I don't even know why<br />
My girlfriend, she's at the end -- she is starting to cry<br />
Let me go on... like I blister in the sun<br />
Let me go on... big hands, I know you're the one<br />
