<p>
Risin' up, back on the street<br />
Did my time, took my chances<br />
Went the distance<br />
Now I'm back on my feet<br />
Just a man and his will to survive<br />
</p><p>
So many times, it happens too fast<br />
You trade your passion for glory<br />
Don't lose your grip on the dreams of the past<br />
You must fight just to keep them alive<br />
</p><p>
It's the eye of the tiger<br />
It's the thrill of the fight<br />
Risin' up to the challenge<br />
Of our rival<br />
And the last known survivor<br />
Stalks his prey in the night<br />
And he's watching us all with the<br />
Eye of the tiger<br />
</p><p>
Face to face, out in the heat<br />
Hangin' tough, stayin' hungry<br />
They stack the odds <br />
Still we take to the street<br />
For the kill with the skill to survive<br />
</p><p>
It's the eye of the tiger<br />
It's the thrill of the fight<br />
Risin' up to the challenge<br />
Of our rival<br />
And the last known survivor<br />
Stalks his prey in the night<br />
And he's watching us all with the<br />
Eye of the tiger<br />
</p><p>
Risin' up straight to the top<br />
Had the guts, got the glory<br />
Went the distance <br />
Now I'm not gonna stop<br />
Just a man and his will to survive<br />
</p><p>
It's the eye of the tiger<br />
It's the thrill of the fight<br />
Risin' up to the challenge<br />
Of our rival<br />
And the last known survivor<br />
Stalks his prey in the night<br />
And he's watching us all with the<br />
Eye of the tiger<br />
</p><p>
The eye of the tiger<br />
