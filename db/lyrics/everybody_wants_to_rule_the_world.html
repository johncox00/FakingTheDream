<p>
Welcome to your life<br /> 
There's no turning back<br /> 
Even while we sleep <br />
We will find you <br />
Acting on your best behaviour <br />
Turn your back on mother nature <br />
Everybody wants to rule the world <br />
</p> 
<p>
It's my own design <br />
It's my own remorse <br />
Help me to decide <br />
Help me make the most <br />
Of freedom and of pleasure <br />
Nothing ever lasts forever <br />
Everybody wants to rule the world<br />
</p>
<p> 
There's a room where the light won't find you <br />
Holding hands while the walls come tumbling down <br />
When they do I'll be right behind you <br />
</p>
<p>
So glad we've almost made it <br />
So sad they had to fade it <br />
Everybody wants to rule the world<br /> 
</p>
<p>
I can't stand this indecision <br />
Married with a lack of vision <br />
Everybody wants to rule the world <br />
Say that you'll never never never never need it <br />
One headline why believe it ? <br />
Everybody wants to rule the world <br />
</p>
<p>
All for freedom and for pleasure <br />
Nothing ever lasts forever <br />
Everybody wants to rule the world<br />
