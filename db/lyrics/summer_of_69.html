<p>
I got my first real six-string<br />
Bought it at the five-and-dime<br />
Played it till my fingers bled<br />
Was the summer of '69<br />
<p></p>
Me and some guys from school<br />
Had a band and we tried real hard<br />
Jimmy quit, Jody got married<br />
Shoulda known, we'd never get far<br />
<p></p>
Oh when I look back now<br />
That summer seemed to last forever<br />
And if I had the choice<br />
Yeah, I'd always want to be there<br />
Those were the best days of my life<br />
<p></p>
Ain't no use in complainin'<br />
When you got a job to do<br />
Spent my evenings down at the drive-in<br />
And that's when I met you<br />
<p></p>
Standin' on your mama's porch<br />
You told me that you'd wait forever<br />
Oh and when you held my hand<br />
I knew that it was now or never<br />
Those were the best days of my life<br />
<p></p>
Oh yeah<br />
Back in the summer of '69<br />
Ohhh<br />
<p></p>
Man we were killin' time<br />
We were young and restless<br />
We needed to unwind<br />
I guess nothin' can last forever, forever, no<br />
<p></p>
And now the times are changin'<br />
Look at everything that's come and gone<br />
Sometimes when I play that old six-string<br />
Think about you wonder what went wrong<br />
<p></p>
Standin' on your mama's porch<br />
You told me it would last forever<br />
Oh and when you held my hand<br />
I knew that it was now or never<br />
Those were the best days of my life<br />
<p></p>
Oh yeah
Back in the summer of '69<br />
Un-huh<br />
It was the summer of '69, oh yeah<br />
Me and my baby in '69, oh<br />
